# WARNING

**This extension is/was made for *educational purpose only* and should be used under your own risk. I am not responsible for any problems/damages caused by the usage of this extension.**

### What does the extension do?

This extension *quietly* opens a new tab, subscribes to PewDiePie and Unsubscribes from T-Series whenever someone loads their Gmail page on a **supported** Chrome browser.

### Why?

Why not?

### Why don't you support T-Series?

Simple. I don't want YouTube to be dominated by big giant companies that spits out 5 new videos every hour.

### Browser support

This extension only works on Chromium/Chrome browser. FYI: [59.69% of the world uses Chromium/Chrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers)
